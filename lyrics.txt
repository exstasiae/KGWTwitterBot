Have you ever been so in love with a girl that you couldn't see past right now?
Well I never put that much faith in the world till the bottom of my world fell out
Everyone has seen things inside their minds / But only things you never really see
I always guessed that I just wasn't made for these times till I realized the times made me
And I'm waiting for the pendulum to swing back / And I'll grab onto the spike and fly
From ignition to the moment of impact / Time just seems to roll on by
Waiting for the moment to hit me / Waiting for two lines to meet
Tendency right foot forward / Probability two left feet
