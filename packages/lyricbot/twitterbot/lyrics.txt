Have you ever been so in love with a girl that you couldn't see past right now?
Well I never put that much faith in the world till the bottom of my world fell out
Everyone has seen things inside their minds / But only things you never really see
I always guessed that I just wasn't made for these times till I realized the times made me
And I'm waiting for the pendulum to swing back / And I'll grab onto the spike and fly
From ignition to the moment of impact / Time just seems to roll on by
Waiting for the moment to hit me / Waiting for two lines to meet
Tendency right foot forward / Probability two left feet
Have you ever seen clouds look all-out morose / When they're passing by the neon sun?
I have yet to shed my skin, but the moment I begin / I'm quite confident that I'll be done
Have you ever felt so wax-winged and upset / That you can't just sit up and say
There's a whole other world that's not moving yet / I wonder if it's going my way?
I've been in the dark for ages / Only right now is there light
Everyone is prone to changes / But most don't give up without a fight
And the future might look quite horrid / But the truth is that I don't mind
Tendency right foot forward / Odds are on left behind
You're just a shapeshifter aping CAKE and Pavement
It's not a case you're makin', it's a statement
Tectonic plates break, constantly changing / The shape of the landscape we're born and raised in
We hesitate in collective amazement / But it just accelerates our displacement
Don't be so dramatic / Your comedy is tragic / You've got a decent act / But you can't compete with magic
Affect a Brooklyn accent / You think you're Woody Allen / But your impression is invalid / You're wasted on your talent
No rest for nomad souls / You can tell by my clothes and my snowman nose
I'm homesick and so sick of get up and go / But some people must not know how to pick up the phone
Quiet, be completely silent / You can get a lot of mileage out of dressing nice and smiling
Lift your eyelids, the mysteries are hiding / In front of you, behind me / So now I hope you might see
You say I never got to ya / What about the Dieffenbachia?
What about the civic opera? / Those were the longest three hours of my life
You know that time is on my side / I got a resume full of sitting around and papers to show I've tried
Jesus knows that I don't wanna lie no more!
I'm like a bull in a china store / That can't make up its mind and it's blind as a donkey / Getting mixed up in these intertwined metaphors
Boxes full of receipts proving dinners in town / Were on the table provided you provided for me / And provided you believe in dinosaurs
So I'll quit while I'm ahead / Before things get violent
Really, what more can I say?
You get a phone call late one night / And then pretty soon you just can't put it down / So you lock the basement tight / And cover the windows to keep the demons out
Thought bubbles cause trouble but you muddle through / Oblivious to what's right in front of you
You were always such a K-G-W
Number one, it's no wonder I got ya / Number two, if you're coming through anytime soon / Could you drop off the Dieffenbachia?
So I'm just chillin' with this length of rope you gave me / Trying to figure out if maybe it's enough to hang myself
And right now I'm leaning towards probably / For all my armchair philosophy, I'm not doing so well
So I sit on the corner of the bed / Mechanically repeat each word I said / To find a rhythm to fit / The grim tenor of this room
And I know you love to misconstrue / The way and things you think I really think of you / But I'm not missing you one bit
I hear you've been living / Room to room and town to town / A hair from down and out / More up and down and round and round
But right now, I'm picturing you dissing me / To dilettantes and philistines / You always talked too loud
But you'll shut your mouth again / No matter what comes out / You'll end up eating humble pie / With a side of your words and foot
And you'll whimper like a hairless dog in winter / And be spared the fog of intercourse
Your bird is cooked / You heard me, look me in the eyes / Tell me you don't see a man who never even tried to love you
Gather the clues and evidence, it doesn't take a gumshoe / To figure out what I'm about and what I have been up to
But whatever, you had your turn, you lost, thank you and fuck you
But it's always a struggle, I'll concede that fact
We live in a bubble, you sleep in the same clothes every night
Each time I'm in trouble, I get a brief flashback / To when my thoughts weren't muddled / And it didn't take so many words to be subtle
Back then I needed the weak, silent type / Someone whose ignorance was virus-like / Someone who smiled despite all the intermittent chaos / In their line of sight and still tried to fight
You say you've got nothing, I don't believe you though / I know when you're bluffing, your brow tends to twitch like an insect's wing
Were you worth your stuffing, you'd harness your need to go / On and on about your loving and focus more on maybe doing something
'Cause I'm afraid your current tack / Is leading you astray, and as for turning back /  You're just no good at that
You tried your hardest but you never could adapt / Now you're as good as trapped
But you can't make an omelette without putting all your eggs into one basket  / And it's just not a funeral without an open casket / You win a few, you lose a lot, you leverage your losses / Regroup, rebuild, and soon enough you hemorrhage your profit
Lost a step trying to run as fast as I could / From you and the bed that we slept in / And I said, "Now I'll never catch up" / And look, I haven't caught up yet
But I'm not upset, because you're not a threat / And I don't know who I'm trying to protect / So drop me a line, we can redisconnect
But I gotta jet, for now, gotta set my alarm / Clean off the makeup, turn on the charm / Get out of my dreams and into my car / But there you are
And I need a charge, the display is so large / And that picture is so unflattering / You're draining me and my battery
So I can't answer the High Tech Computer Magician / "Decline" will automatically transfer you to voicemail / Where you can leave a message I won't listen to / Blame it on bad reception / Try and try again you can't get through
Like I can't get through to you / That we were never anything, really, but we're through / I know it sounds romantic and silly but it's true / What do you want me to do?
I could change all the locks or I could turn back the clock / And you call me a cock, but I'm not, so you call me a lot
You got what you want, now it's all that you got / We fought and we fought and you came out on top / But now it must stop
So maybe you could call me sometime / When you're having trouble falling asleep
And I can be cool to be unkind / And you listen to me
Well, aren't I just a ray of sunshine? / But this is a set-up, and you are the punchline
I remember when you'd take my hand / And ask me if I liked your favorite band / I said, "Yes. Well, they're alright, I guess But they're growing on me less each day"
Now I must admit that the game is stale / Everything's the same but the flame has bailed
I say, "Please, my favorite band is Squeeze / I have all of their CDs except for Babylon and On
I see you in the doorway / Ice blue like Norway eyes in the vanishing light
Oh, flattery is my forte / But I'll say no more, say no more / You look ravishing tonight!
And I can't believe myself / It's rather obvious that you need my help / So I'll stay, if you want me to stay / I've got nothing left to say anyway
It's easy to forget that I'm not alone / Every time I call and you're not at home / I let it ring, you don't mean anything / Oh, you mean everything and it's making me cry
I see you on the staircase / Descending like hair, face, and eyes / Detached from your mind
Oh, I look out to the road / With every doubt on the globe and say / My, you look ravishing tonight!
The sweetest symphony is full of hot despair / But all too soon you're erasing my whole kiss / A dance we had six years ago when we were young and scared / Full of empty promises and threats
So we complain about a place we'd never been / And argued over pictures in a book / It always feels so incomplete, another day, another street / Another sweet, uneasy look
I used to know just what I'd say if you confronted me / How come I can't remember now?
You ask why I write such good songs, I think it's plain to see / I have to let it out somehow
No one can sing like me / And no one can play guitar like me / And no one says the things I say / And no one else ever feels this way
I can't explain myself / It would sound much better from someone else / But you chose me, and you were wrong / And that's why I write such good songs
In the time it takes to make one mistake, you're up and gone / And I'm so tired that I just watch you run
You always hide my evidence and clean your snowflake fingerprints / Off the loaded barrel of my tongue
I can't ignore you anymore but what else can I say? / It seems absurd to argue now
I guess we should have kept in touch 'cause when you can't talk, you think too much / And it all builds up 'til it all comes out
When everything I try to say comes out so foolishly / I have no choice except to lie
So when I tell you that I hate the things you do to me / I wonder why I even try
One minute is all it took / And now I get it, hey, look / There's a lot of history here, let me tell you / I hope you're sitting down, baby
Sorry, it took so long / But you were far away / And I just found your phone number today / So I'll spit it out now, baby
Are you feeling me? / I don't believe your stories / You're no more brave than you used to be
Oh, take me seriously / Oh, I pretend that I'm naive / But it still hurts and I still breathe
But while I'm quick to admit that the outlook's bleak / I'm pulling in five hundred bucks a week / And I'm fine with the way things are, and I'm in love
Oh, and there's nothing I would rather do / Than anything involving you / You're still the one I can't stop thinking of
Got lost on the Penna Turnpike / The grey moon as bright as a prison searchlight / How soon we forget how much it hurt the first time
And I smiled at the stroke of midnight / 'Cause I knew the trap I'm in is skintight / Somehow I know we'll get by
Because I'm much smarter now / I know all your secrets and even they don't get me down
You're hard to figure out / And even harder to please, but that's what I need / I know it's hard to believe but just trust me
I know how it feels to be seventeen / To be young and in love and feel so unclean / To just lie in your bed and pray that your eyes won't close
'Cause heaven only knows how much I dream about you / 'Cause I know what I'd be without you / And that's the saddest image I have seen
Oh, you run right through my scarred cuirass / And shatter my heart of glass / And how hard I'll laugh when I cash in the insurance policy
You say it's obvious, then prefer honesty / Well, I'm in no mood to defend my immodesty / So let's just pretend that I've ended my odyssey
Where else can I go? / You're the sweetest girl I know / I'm pregnant and I'm coming home to you / But what can you do?
There's been some indiscretion / But who needs an ancient history lesson / I feel good, and you look fetching / Oh, as if there's any question
When I held you last night, I could not believe / That some day not too long off I would have to leave
But I can't tell you what you'll always mean to me / There's things you just can't say, and apparently just can't see
But I know that sooner or later, we'll be together / Everything can't keep going wrong forever
Well I don't know what you want and what I want and whatever / But things have been worse, but things could be better
Maybe you can't be the girl I want you to / Maybe you don't understand yourself, but see, I do / So maybe there's an answer -- I'm asking you
There's so many things that I can't keep a perspective / I'm losing sight of the primary objective
I want to say "to heck with it," things are getting hectic / But every now and then there's that glimmer of perfection
But all the time I don't know what's good for me / Or which way to go / And I told myself I didn't care about that / But I cut myself in half
There's a time for changing, and for letting go / I can't save the future now, but let me know
Where I think I'm going, what I've left behind / What I look forward to knowing, what I hope to find / All leads back to one place, straight into your arms / I can't be complete unless I know where you are
Uh, this message is for Mr. Fincher. Uh, my call is in reference to David Fincher, and my name is David Fincher. David, please contact Mr. Fincher. You can call collect at 708-FINCHER. Again, my name is Mr. Fincher, and my name is Mr. Fincher. Please call. Thank you. 
She goes the way she came / Like a fragment of a nightmare / You had when you were fifteen years old
So every word / Drips with bittersweet reverb / Distorted by the silence of the room
So here we are / Asleep in Cakewalk 9 / Breathing bullets like an airgun / While a spider-coloured glass / Of a sharp delayed guitar / Fills with the smoke of an uncompressed snare drum
Do we forget the lives we've lived as new ones come along? / And can you fall asleep to someone else's favorite song?
We find our strength grow steadily as love and hope decrease / So withholding hands we seize the strings and cringe at each release
The road's a wolf that sneaks / From points A and B to some new empty house / With one light on and three cars in the drive
And that's why we speak / To try and bridge the tender gap / Between breathing and being alive
And the echo-filled fog / Has you thinking that the element of surprise / Is more familiar than it seems
And so you drive / And spit your hopes and fears / Through the exhaust pipe in a stream of dreamy steam
So why remember when it takes no effort to forget? / Pretend you spent the night alone the day we never met
The only time you lose yourself is when you think you know / That the heavy hands that hold you hostage have to let you go
Jackie Gleason said / One of these days you'll be dead, Alice
Sippin hemlock from a lead chalice / Lest ye anger the Cheshire Cat with the bedside manner of a desperate actress
So you bend her backwards, just to see if it quenches that thirst
Call your conscribed contractors, tell em you need it faster
Liam Neeson said / Just do a half assed job you skeleton / Who gives a rat's ass, not this mendicant
All you need is your feeling / But all you see is your ceiling
And your honesty is appealing / To my immodesty, but now obviously, it’s preposterously unrevealing
Be a decent friend, even when you're on the receiving end
Need to beat you til you can scream again
That's the only way, just keep living like Matt McConaughey with a shit eating grin
I could've said, “time to hit the woodshed”
Would you forget about Hollywood then, you made your bedsores / lay into them with a bayonet cuz
Cuz all you need is your feeling / Call and read for a meeting
And while the tape machines are squealing / You will finally see, I move silently / Meanwhile privately, I am reeling
Kevin Rowlands said / If you need a melody, why not mine? / Fine, I don't mind, you got more line items to prioritize / Than I've seen in my entire life
Just put a credit in the liner note fine print / Hope you're doing well, I don't care if you like it
Cuz all I need is your feeling / But all human beings are needy / And we all agree we are greedy
But then honestly, this is a mockery / Let's do it properly, and completely
Ay yo, you and I, we're all gonna die / It's just a matter of what time
Maybe no, maybe why, baby don't cry / Either way the days keep blowing by
Exeunt, occupied, back to front, side to side / Say goodbye to the life you say you despise
Away we go, taking flight, taking notes, making nice / Crazy tropes, every motif a gold mine
Maybe time to recalculate your cosigns / Baby drinkin rosé, okay, so fine
Tell me what the log say, whaddya know bout crossplay / Why don't we make a video where you're dressed up like an osprey?
Things get furry then turn fuzzy in a hurry / We need to talk about Billy Joel and Brian Doyle Murray
You're listening to Focus while your world is going blurry / Wake me when the locusts fill the sky, and then I'll worry
I'm making a mistake! I'm making a mistake! Everybody look at me, I'm making a mistake!
How much would it take, til the bound begins to break / I’m not proud or ashamed, I'm allowed to be afraid
But hey, there's an easy way out / Just say, that you need me there now / Where I can't be bothered, where I won't be found
The death of the author will be underground / And they will call me the godfather of sound
We're just joshin' around, but for real, now
I can speak shit into existence, memory is impersistent
So clocks melt existentially, and novels self referentially revolve around these pretentious themes / Preserving diseases long cured and unseen / Until herds of adverbs amass in the desert / And desert the red earth for a new universe
Cockroaches, dirt obelisks and wizards
We did what we did, we obviously deserve / What we get, but what gets me is what didn't work / What weapons we drew, when we withdrew our words
And what happened to you? You were with me, you were / Then you ditched me to do, what you didn't to her
And I miss you, you imperfect specimen, you / But I'll get you, or get close to getting to you / Exeunt
Thelema made Louise think that she's afraid of me / Ugh, I'm such a fucking witch, feels like every time I speak
I can't help but manifest someone automagically / Who just analyses and then quickly grammatizes me
I'm so busy counting sheep, I forget that I'm asleep / It’s a life long dream and I’m several layers deep
So please, Louise / Read up on Thelema and speak to the demons with me
Refactor your schema and re-examine your beliefs, Louise
In the clip-on book light you kinda look like Crowley / And it's affecting me romantically
And I'm champing at the bit, clamping off the tip / Of a cigar I just lit which leaves a circumcision scar
The future isn't far, acknowledge who you are / Maybe you should drop the freegan act and buy a fucking car
Tie it to a star, try to fly it through the heart of the moon (It's a start!) / It'll do (It's an art!) / It's a ruse
Sleight of hand with a squirt of social lube / You're no Christian Rosenkreuz, your submission's overdue
So please, Louise / I’m scared of your dreams and your past and your brash honesty
Louise, you could tear me to pieces like that and you're laughing at me
I think I'm Tom Lehrer / But Tom Green is a lot fairer
I think I'm Harry Shearer / It's like looking in a god damn mirror!
In the abstract, you'll go far, but I can see past that: you're no star! / You worry too much and you work too hard / Just who in the world do you think you are?
Cause it's a cruel fucking world out there for a frail troubadour with puffy clown hair
Old criticisms, young critiques; everything is such a bitch-fest, tongues in cheeks.
In the long run, we all lose / Doesn't matter if you're Tom Thumb or Tom Cruise / Everybody wants to see something beyond the truth / Everybody wants to be someone else but you.
I think I'm Jerry Samuels, lost in diagnostic manuals.
I used to think I was a rapper - apparently I had it backwards; nowadays it sounds like they are me.
I think I'm Bill Hicks, Dylan, Pollard... I think I'm William Roberts
But I'll never have a billion dollars / And that's all I ever really wanted
So I think, would I really say all of this in front of a studio audience? / It's not the internet, where you can get bought by a holdco or melt into a conglomerate.
So maybe I'll remain anonymous-ish or drop some straight ignominious shit / Up or down, at least you've got a position, fuck, at least you're not a musician!
I know you've been lying to your therapist / Telling him horrible things
It doesn't take much to make an idiot out of an autodidact
God, it's like I'm talking to God sometimes / And it's not sometimes, and it's not quite right somehow / But let's be honest, I slept through a lot of it
I put a picture of my dick on Facebook / And then I slipped into a hole when they took my profile down
That's why I lay upon my bathroom floor for more than ten weeks / Self-medicating with menthol cigarettes and Hennessey / I swear these 50 fexofenadine will be the death of me
You're listening to Belle and Sebastian in the middle of the night / Meanwhile, I'm in the best shape of my life
Who's got time for brandywine and laudanum and ladyfriends?
She goes the way she came / Like a fragment of a nightmare you had when you were fifteen years old
So every word drips with bittersweet reverb / Distorted by the silence of the room
So here we are, asleep in Cakewalk 9 / Breathing bullets like an airgun
While a spider-coloured glass of a sharp delayed guitar / Fills with the smoke of an uncompressed snare drum
Do we forget the lives we've lived as new ones come along? / And can you fall asleep to someone else's favorite song?
We find our strength grow steadily as love and hope decrease / So withholding hands we seize the strings and cringe at each release
The road's a wolf that sneaks from points A and B to some new empty house / With one light on and three cars in the drive
And that's why we speak; To try and bridge the tender gap / Between breathing and being alive
So why remember when it takes no effort to forget? / Pretend you spent the night alone the day we never met
The only time you lose yourself is when you think you know / That the heavy hands that hold you hostage have to let you go
It's soft where you stopped, so stay soft
It could be rotting your mind or beating out of your chest / It could be infinite lives or merely Infinite Jest
I heard the Bostonians keeping classic thoughts in their throats
Things that I don't know are not important to me / I am a Bostonian, if that's what I want to be
You're a citizen of where you are, not where you belong
But please no more questions or forced confessions / Or Russian roulette with Cold War weapons
Ah, ah, this part is the best / When he carves in his chest with a blunt Sheaffer Crest pen: / "Hatred is self-esteem expressed in binary and crushed and magnified electronically" 
And, "Sainthood is an extreme form of hate speech, it all depends on your direction and speed"
But you cruise through in the two-door / With the 22’s and the humidor in the dashboard, let loose the gas pedal
So I hope you have a rote rehash / Of a thought-provoking quote from a grocery bag
Thanks for the flashes of Mozart madness / And the Ozark folk art and soul dispassion
Whistle when you need dismissal, or approval / Or a little psycho-critical strudel
Just yodel, when you're mixed-episodal / Episodic, whatever, just holler when you're psychotic / I’ll get a motel, it'll go well probably
Secret thinking as they call it, mental telepathy
So don't say a word now, baby, it's alright when sweet things die
Every interaction is a de-duplicated unique
Tjeerd does not smoke weed / He says it makes you dull and boring
Fly to Amsterdam and get fucked
Whispering dulcet tones in your ear: “I’m a terrorist, you're a saint, and a therapist / Listening to bullshit loaded with fear!" / But it's nice just to know you can hear
Sell your stereo and scream as fucking loud as you can
Rendering obsolete the plot you brewed to not smoke weed today
Everybody knows nobody needs a friendly sound
And your teenage dreams are ending now / So put the Unrest records down
Listen to the sound your heart makes / A feeling you have can't be wrong
Five guitars, and they all look like yours
Oh listen to the words you can't say / There's a shadow that cloaks every sound
What is it about my birthday? / Everything gets turned around
Listen to the music your heart plays / Record it, and write it down
The room is filled with music I can't play / At least not in my current state
Five guitars, and they all look like ours
And I bet you'd like to see them / And hear the sounds they've made
The strongest man alive / The strongest man alive / The strongest man alive / The strongest man alive / The strongest man alive
But the ball's in your court anyway / I will hold you till you die
The sesquicentennial came without notice this year
If I can’t fuck you anymore / Whatchu coming over for?
Her only secret was that she was mine
If you wanna leave me, leave me alone
Well I guess you maybe caught me / Acting when I couldn’t act
I'm much happier than I seem to be / Life is laugh-out-loud hilarious twenty-four hours a day
I've gone halfway down to dumb and heaven only knows what's next
I'm out of time and I am fucked
Two guitars, one manic and one angry
She buried me in Tennessee / Far away from Venice Beach and all the enemies I've made here
But as they drop my body into the brusque, indignant earth / I know you'll realize how sorry you are, for whatever it's worth
But it's a long, long, long way down from here / Still a long, long, long way down
Oh my, it's a long way down
Our bodies shook and then you fell away / As if you had been exorcised
In ecstasy then depossessed / And then crouched weeping, knees to chest
Your head on a silver platter is of no interest to me
